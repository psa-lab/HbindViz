The Hbind open source software is available at \nhttps://github.com/psa-lab/Hbind\n.\n\n\nOnce you have it installed, you can execute the following command based on the two example files provided in the \n./example_files\n subdirectory (the structure of an \nPKCI-substrate analog\n with its ligand, adenosine monophsophate):\n\n\nhbind -p ./example_files/1KPF.pdb -l ./example_files/1KPF_AMP.mol2\n\n\n\nAfter executing the command above, you should see the following output in your terminal:\n\n\nHBIND Version: 1.0.0\n\nDocumentation: http://psa-lab.github.io/hbind\nRaschka, Wolf, Bemister-Buffington, Kuhn (2018)\nProtein Structure and Analysis Lab, MSU (http://kuhnlab.bmb.msu.edu)\n\nLigand file: /Users/sebastian/code/hbind/example_files/1KPF_AMP.mol2\nProtein file: /Users/sebastian/code/hbind/example_files/1KPF.pdb\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ HBind Interaction Table ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n#            | Ligand Atom -- Protein  Atom | Bond   D-H-A  Ligand-Protein\n#            |  #  TYPE    -- RES  CH_ID  RES_NO  A_TYPE | DIST.

(\nPython 3.6\n or greater is recommended.)\n\n\nOnce you have generated the Hbind interaction table (an example is available at \n./example_files/hbind_output.txt\n), you can execute the following command to generate the PyMOL commands for visualizing the protein-ligand hydrogen-bond interaction network:\n\n\npython code/hbind_pymol_cmds.py example_files/hbind_output.txt\n\n\n\nThe execution of the previous command should return the following output in your terminal:\n\n\nhide lines\nshow cartoon\nshow sticks, ligand\nset sphere_scale=0.32\nshow sticks, (protein and chain A and resi 43)\nshow sticks, (protein and chain A and resi 44)\nshow sticks, (protein and chain A and resi 112)\nshow sticks, (protein and chain A and resi 114)\nshow sticks, (protein and chain A and resi 99)\nshow sticks, (protein and chain A and resi 108)\nshow sticks, (protein and chain A and resi 107)\nshow sphere, (ligand and id 22)\nshow sphere, (ligand and id 10)\nshow sphere, (ligand and id 4)\nshow sphere, (ligand and id 12)\nshow sphere, (ligand and id 3)\nshow sphere, (ligand and id 2)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/ASN`99/ND2\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/ASN`99/ND2,(ligand and id 2)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/SER`107/N\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/SER`107/N,(ligand and id 3)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/VAL`108/N\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/VAL`108/N,(ligand and id 3)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/HIS`112/NE2\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/HIS`112/NE2,(ligand and id 4)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/HIS`114/NE2\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/HIS`114/NE2,(ligand and id 4)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/ASP`43/OD2\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/ASP`43/OD2,(ligand and id 10)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/ASP`43/OD1\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/ASP`43/OD1,(ligand and id 12)\nshow sphere, /protein//A/ILE`44/N\ndistance hbond, /protein//A/ILE`44/N,(ligand and id 22)\nset dash_color, yellow, hbond\nhide labels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip:\n \n\n\nIf you are using a Linux/Unix terminal, you can redirect the outputs from Hbind or \nhbind_pymol_cmds.py\n to text files so that you don't need to copy it manually from the terminal. For example, the command for the redirect to \nmy_output.txt\n would be as follows:\n\n\npython code/hbind_pymol_cmds.py example_files/hbind_output.txt > my_output.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Executing the generated PyMOL commands to visualize hydrogen-bonds in PyMOL\n\n\nAfter obtaining the commands for creating the H-bond visualization in PyMOL (see Step 2), open the protein and ligand structures in PyMOL:\n\n\n\n\nNext, rename the protein structure (here: \"1KPF\") to \"protein\" and the ligand structure (here: \"1KPF_AMP\") to \"ligand\" as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, copy and paste the commands from Step 2 into the PyMOL command prompt and hit enter to see the hydrogen bonds visualized:\n\n\n\n\n(Note that the Hbind table only lists the heavy atoms that participate in hydrogen bond interactions; thus, hydrogen positions are ignored in the HbondViz script, and you may want to hide these in PyMOL.)",

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n  meet the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n\n(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n      stating that You changed the files; and\n\n\n(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n      the Derivative Works; and\n\n\n(d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n      as modifying the License.\n\n\nYou may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n  the conditions stated in this License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nCopyright 2018 Michigan State University\n\n\nThe HbindViz software was developed by Sebastian Raschka\nand Leslie A.
